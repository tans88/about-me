            I am a senior at California High School in San Ramon. Some of my favorite subjects are math and biology. 
            I love to listen to music, travel, play sports, hang out with friends, and so much more!! I have always been interested in 
            nature and the environment, especially the oceans. This interest drove me to do more research on marine life, specifically 
            on whales and dolphins. My research later inspired me to create a webpage using the knowledge I acquired of HTML and CSS.

            I began coding over the summer through online education platforms like Codecademy and Khan Academy. 
            Through these, I was able to expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java and have created a few personal projects 
            to practice and showcase these skills. Using my skills, I have created small games, webpages, and programs using HTML, CSS, 
            and Java. Coding has allowed me to combine my creativity with my love for math and computers and being able to create games 
            and webpages gives me a way to express myself. It has also taught me to be more patient and persevere through any bugs or 
            issues that may come up. I hope to enrich myself with more programming knowledge and create more applications, games, and 
            websites in the future!
